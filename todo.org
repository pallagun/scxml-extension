* diagram
** TODO get arrow dragging from one edge to another functioning.
** TODO get arrow disconntion/reconnection working
* link
** TODO update drawing from xml
* bugs - ordered
** DONE need a unit test for changing the target of a hinted transition
** DONE when dragging a transition's edit points and the edge snaps to another edge it needs to be stick for first/last edit idx.
** DONE can't make a child state in a parallel??
** DONE adding an Initial element with the I key will put the initial drawing inside a relocated drawing.

* features - ordered
** TODO need to be able to draw initial elements (or attributes) with the right click menu.
*** DONE Be able to drop an <initial> with the mouse
*** TODO Be able to go between <inital> and initial="" format with mouse
*** TODO Be able to drag/drop the end point of a disconnected transition that's a child of an Initial.  can't move it?
** TODO graphical feature to show differences between State, Final and Parallel elements.
** TODO get rid of the constant sized portions of boxes, move labels above/below.
** DONE make the 'event' in a transition go away when there are no events, not be event=""
** TODO be able to disconnect a transition and reconnect it graphically (with mouse?)
** TODO make sure the scxml---* attributes are always last in the element's attributes
** DONE unable to move transitions around when they're synthetic?
** DONE setting any drawing back to auto when hinted won't update the xml when linking?
** DONE Unable to build a drawing from an <scxml> document if it's got 'type="external"' in a transition attribute?
** DONE click-drag creation for any box (state, parallel, final)
* questions
** TODO how do you 'downcast' an object and tell it to invoke generic functions based off that casting?
** TODO should the drawing-elements be doing more of diagram-mode.el's work?
* too much work to do now
** You should be able to pull a transition off of the state it's hooked to.
